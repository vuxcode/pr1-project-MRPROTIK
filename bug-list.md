# Bug List
Here is some the bug list which I faced during the process working time.

1.	Remaining time: When I want to play again the remaining timer is not working properly.
2.	Rulls page: I want to show the rules page in the center but still it shows the corner. If I have more time I can fix the problem.
3.	Show questions: I want to show the question randomly with their option and give the user to select the correct option. I believe it will take more time to do that. 

I hope and believe that there is lots of things man can do in this project and I will do it shortly.
