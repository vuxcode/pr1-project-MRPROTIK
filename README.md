# User Guide

User Guide for Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Game.

Welcome to the Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) game. This game will help you guide and face new experiences. I will write a user guide for those who want to use my program and play quizzes. 

Start the Quiz: To start the quiz you need to click on the HTML file and open any browser. After clicking you will see a page which contains the basic rules of this game. For this section, I write the code at the beginning of the HTML file.

Show the Question: After reading all the rules you will see that clicking the Let's Play button will show the question with four options. You will also see the remaining time for each question. For this section, I set the question container and question in an HTML file. I also set four option buttons in the question container because the option will show after the question. When you click on an option the rest of the time it will automatically move to the next question. But if you don't click the option with remaining time you will go to the next option. 

Choose an option: You can choose only one option at a time When you select one option you have no chance to select the other. It will also show whether the option you selected is correct. If you select correct answer it will show green mark or if you select wrong answer it will also show red mark it will show green mark on correct options. 

Show Score: When you finish all the questions and select your answer it will show your total score and the percentage you have scored. If you want to play again, you will see a play again button.
Expected results: 
A fully functional quiz game that provides an enjoyable and educational experience. A scalable platform that can handle multiple users simultaneously.
